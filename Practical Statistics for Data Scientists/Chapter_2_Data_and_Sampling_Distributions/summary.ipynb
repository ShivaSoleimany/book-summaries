    "# Chapter 2: Data and Sampling Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resampling Versus Bootstrapping\n",
    "- The term resampling often includes permutation procedures and implies sampling with replacement from an observed data set.\n",
    "- The bootstrap (sampling with replacement from a data set) is powerful for assessing the variability of a sample statistic.\n",
    "- Bootstrapping allows estimation of sampling distributions for statistics where no mathematical approximation has been developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Confidence Intervals\n",
    "- Confidence intervals present estimates as an interval range and are constructed from the same population.\n",
    "- The width of the interval is influenced by the level of confidence and the size of the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Normal Distribution\n",
    "- The normal distribution, or Gaussian distribution, is central to statistical analysis, representing data distribution with a mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "- Standard normal distributions and QQ-Plots are tools used to determine how closely a data set follows a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Student’s t-Distribution\n",
    "- The t-distribution is used to estimate confidence intervals and compare means from different sample sizes, statistics, and numbers of groups.\n",
    "- It has thicker tails compared to the normal distribution and is used extensively in sample statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binomial Distribution\n",
    "- Binomial outcomes represent two possible outcomes (success/failure) and are used to understand probabilities of different numbers of successes in a set number of trials.\n",
    "- Binomial distribution helps calculate the probability of a given number of successes in a sample size with a specified probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chi-Square Distribution\n",
    "- The chi-square distribution measures the extent to which observed counts deviate from expected counts, standardizing the difference for comparison.\n",
    "- It is used for tests of independence and goodness-of-fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## F-Distribution\n",
    "- The F-distribution is used in ANOVA to compare variability among group means to variability within groups.\n",
    "- It helps understand the decomposition of variance components.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Poisson and Related Distributions\n",
    "- The Poisson distribution models the frequency of events over time or space, assuming a constant rate (λ).\n",
    "- Related distributions include the exponential distribution (time between events) and the Weibull distribution (changing event rates over time).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exponential Distribution\n",
    "- The exponential distribution models the time between events using the rate parameter (λ).\n",
    "- It is applicable for queuing models and failure rate analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weibull Distribution\n",
    "- The Weibull distribution extends the exponential distribution to allow for changing event rates over time.\n",
    "- It is specified by shape (β) and scale (η) parameters, useful for time-to-failure analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Highlights\n",
    "- Understanding the different types of distributions helps in accurately modeling and analyzing statistical data.\n",
    "- Bootstrapping and resampling are crucial techniques for assessing variability without extensive mathematical approximations.\n",
    "- Confidence intervals and distribution types (normal, t, binomial, chi-square, F, Poisson, exponential, Weibull) are essential tools in statistical inference and hypothesis testing.\n"
